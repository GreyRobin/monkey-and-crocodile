once upon a time there was a forest, there lived a monkey on the berry tree, which was on the banks of the river
in the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife....
one day the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree
the kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruit
the crocodile came the next day for more fruit
as days passed by, the crocodile and monkey became best friends
